## 1. Messaging Strategy

### Core Value Proposition

**Old Message (Cost-focused):**
> "Generate UGC ads for ₹499"

**New Message (Value-focused):**
> "Replace $12,000 worth of UGC creators with $239/month. Test 10x more creative variations."

### Key Talking Points

**Why the Price Increase:**
1. "Upgraded to Veo 3.1 (Google's latest AI) - costs 3x more per second"
2. "Still 90% cheaper than hiring UGC creators ($1,200/video)"
3. "Better margins = more features (priority queue, 4K, API access)"

**Customer Benefits:**
1. "Test 37 video variations for the cost of 1 traditional UGC video"
2. "Iterate in 60 seconds instead of 5 days"
3. "Scale from 5 to 50 videos/month without hiring"

## 4. Objection Handling Guide

### Common Objections + Responses

**1. "This is way too expensive!"**
```
Response: "I totally understand the sticker shock. Let me show you 
the math: Our Creator Pack ($239) gets you 37 videos. Hiring one 
UGC creator for one video costs $1,200. You're saving $43,000+ for 
the same output. We're still the cheapest option by 90%."
```

**2. "I can't afford this."**
```
Response: "We have a Starter Pack at $99 for 50 credits (~12 videos). 
That's $8/video. And if that's still a stretch, stay tuned—we're 
testing a smaller $49 tier for solopreneurs."
```

**3. "I just bought credits at the old price!"**
```
Response: "Great news—you're grandfathered! You can buy more credits 
at the old pricing until Apr 18. Plus, if you buy now, use code 
EARLY2026 for 20% off on top of old pricing."
```

**4. "Why should I trust this will be worth it?"**
```
Response: "Fair question. Here's what we're investing the extra revenue 
into: priority generation queues (2-3x faster), 4K exports, API access, 
and dedicated support. Want to see a demo of the new features?"
```

**5. "I'll just use competitors like Runway."**
```
Response: "Totally your call! Quick comparison: Runway is $15/video 
for generic AI. We're $6/video for UGC-specific templates optimized 
for ad performance. Plus, we do 60-second generation vs their 3-5 
minutes. Happy to send a comparison sheet."
```

### Social Media Campaign

**Twitter/LinkedIn (Feb 15-18):**

```
We just 20x'd our pricing. Here's why it's still a steal 🧵

1/ Two months ago, we charged $6 for 15 credits. Now it's $99 for 50.

2/ "That's crazy!" you might think. But let me show you the math...

3/ Cost to generate 1 video:
- Veo 3.1: $3.60
- Imagen 4: $0.20
- Voiceover: $0.30
Total: $4.11 per video

4/ At old pricing ($6 / 15 credits = $0.40/credit), we were losing 
$0.63 per credit. Unsustainable.

5/ But here's the thing: even at $99, you're getting 50 credits 
(~12 videos) for $8.25/video.

6/ Compare that to hiring a UGC creator: $1,200/video.

You're still saving 99%.

7/ The hard truth: we were underpriced. AI isn't cheap. Veo 3.1 
costs us $0.15/second. That's $3.60 per 24-second video in raw 
compute alone.

8/ So yes, we raised prices. Because we want to be around in 2027, 
not burn out in 6 months.

9/ And with sustainable pricing, we can build: priority queues, 
4K exports, API access, dedicated support.

10/ If you're already a customer: your credits are safe. You can 
lock in old pricing until Apr 18.

Early bird: 20% off with code EARLY2026 👇

## 6. Customer Retention Strategy

### High-Risk Customers (Target for Proactive Outreach)

**Identify:**
- Customers with 5+ purchases in past 90 days
- Customers who purchased in last 14 days (may feel cheated)
- Customers with >100 credits remaining (high investment)

**Outreach:**
```
Subject: Quick note on pricing changes

I noticed you're an active IgniteAI user (thank you!). Wanted to 
personally reach out about the upcoming pricing changes.

TL;DR: Your credits are safe, you're grandfathered until Apr 18.

But I also wanted to say thank you for being an early supporter. 
As a token of appreciation, I'm adding 25 bonus credits to your 
account (on the house).

If you have any questions or concerns, hit reply. I read every email.

Best,

P.S. If you have feedback on what features would make the new 
pricing worthwhile, I'm all ears.
