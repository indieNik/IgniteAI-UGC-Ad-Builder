        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Your subscription will remain
            active until the end of the current billing period.</p>
        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Strict No-Refund Policy:</strong> Since we sell digital assets (AI-generated photos & videos) which
            cannot be retrieved once accessed or delivered, we generally do NOT offer refunds.</p>

        <p>However, if you encounter a system error where the asset was not generated but credits were deducted, please
            reach out to our support team. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Make sure to capture relevant screenshots of the
            error before reaching out to Support.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to refuse a refund request if we detect potential abuse of our policy or violation of
            our Terms of Service.</p>
