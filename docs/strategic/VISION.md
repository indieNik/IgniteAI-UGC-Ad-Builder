## Our Mission

> **Democratize professional video advertising by making AI-powered UGC creation accessible, affordable, and iteration-friendly for every brand.**

We believe every founder, marketer, and creator deserves the ability to test creative hypotheses at the speed of thought—without shipping products, hiring actors, or waiting weeks for production.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### 1. Creative Fatigue is Killing ROI
Modern performance marketing requires **constant creative iteration**. What works today stops working tomorrow. Brands burn through creative concepts faster than they can produce them.

**Traditional Solution:** Hire UGC creators ($1,200/video), wait 5-7 days, hope it performs.  
**Result:** Slow iteration cycles, expensive testing, poor ROI.

### 2. The Testing Gap
Brands want to test 10+ hooks before investing in full production. But testing costs $12,000-50,000 before you even know what works.

**The Paradox:** You need to spend money to learn how to spend money efficiently.

### 3. Scale Bottleneck
Successful ads require dozens of variations (different hooks, CTAs, angles). Traditional production can't scale to meet this demand.

**Agency Model:** $80,000/month for 10 videos  
**Creator Model:** $12,000/month for 10 videos (if you manage logistics)

## Core Values

### 1. **Speed is a Feature**
Every workflow decision optimizes for time-to-first-video. If it takes >2 minutes, we failed.

### 2. **Iteration Over Perfection**
We don't generate "perfect" videos. We generate **testable variations** so you can find what works.

### 3. **Transparent Pricing**
No hidden fees, no bait-and-switch. Credits never expire. What you buy is what you get.

### 4. **Customer Success = Our Success**
We win when your ads perform. We measure success by customer ROI, not just revenue.

### 5. **AI as a Tool, Not a Threat**
We're not replacing creators—we're enabling **more people** to create. Creators use us to prototype before shooting.

## What We Don't Do

**Clarity through constraints:**

❌ We don't build generic AI video tools (that's Runway's game)  
❌ We don't do long-form content (that's Descript's game)  
❌ We don't do professional studio production (that's agencies' game)  
❌ We don't compete on price (we compete on speed + iteration)  
❌ We don't chase every feature request (we stay focused on UGC ads)  

✅ We do **one thing incredibly well:** Generate testable UGC ad variations in 60 seconds

---

## Team Philosophy

### Who We Hire
**Small team, high output.** We hire:
- **T-shaped generalists** who can wear multiple hats
- **Customer-obsessed builders** who talk to users weekly
- **Speed demons** who ship fast, iterate faster
- **Learners** who adapt as AI models evolve monthly

### Who We Don't Hire
- People who need perfect specs before building
- Feature-factory engineers who don't understand the business
- Marketers who don't understand the product
- Anyone who says "that's not my job"

---

## 10-Year Moonshot

**By 2036, we want:**

> **Every performance marketer's first action when testing a new campaign is: "Generate 10 variations in IgniteAI."**

We become the **Figma of video ads**—the default collaborative workspace where ideas become testable creative in seconds.

**Ultimate Vision:**
- 5M+ registered users
- $100M ARR
- Industry standard for creative testing
- Acquired by Meta/Google for $500M-1B OR continue as profitable indie company

---

## Why This Matters

**Personal Mission:**

Creative testing shouldn't be a luxury reserved for brands with $100K/month ad budgets. Every founder with a great product deserves the tools to find their message-market fit.

We're building the future where **ideas beat budgets**.
